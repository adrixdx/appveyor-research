## AppVeyor

Appveyor is a specific tool made to facilitate the automatization of continuous integration, continuous delivery and continuous deployment.

And those pillars means:

-Continuous integration: It's a practice wich integrates all the changes produced in a repository with the server of compilation and ensures every single change in the application is being validated in the recopilation of the questions and the unit tests. 
The main objectives of continuous integration are: find and correct errors faster and optimize software quality.In addition, it also reduces the time it takes to validate and release new versions of an application.


-Continuous delivery:Step that is made after continuous integration. It is about having the necessary elements of the application for its distribution.


-Continuous deployment:Very similar to continuous delivery. However, in this mode, after the build server performs the validation of the build and code, the package is also prepared. However, the distribution / deployment is done automatically in the desired environment.


By the fact of using the continuous integration, thanks to AppVeyor we have a series of benefits like:

-Productivity increase

-Bug identification

-Simple and quick distribution


###How to use AppVeyor

First of all, we need to create and account in AppVeyor
![](https://github.com/adrixdx/appveyor-research/blob/master/research/sign%20up.jpg)

You can create an account of AppVeyor or sign in with an account of Github, VisualStudio Online,or BitBucket.


You have different packages:


-Basic: Wich costs 29$/month and allows you to have 1 private project, 1 concurrent job, 1 GB build cache and forum support.


-Pro: Wich costs 59$/month or 590$/year and allows you to have unlimited private project, 1 concurrent job, 5 GB build cache and priority technical support.


-Premium:Wich costs 99$/month or 990$/year and allows you to have unlimited private project, 2 concurrent job, 20 GB build cache and priority technical support.


Also you have a free trial of 14 days.

After you create an account, now you can select a repository of different programming tools:

Select one and you can start using AppVeyor. In that case, it's using a Github repository.


Now you have your project and the first you have to do to see the utility of AppVeyor is create a new build:

This will integrate all the changes mades until the last commit
