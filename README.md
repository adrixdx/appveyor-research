## AppVeyor
Appveyor is a specific tool made to facilitate the automatization of continuous integration, continuous delivery and continuous deployment.

And those pillars means:

-Continuous integration: It's a practice wich integrates all the changes produced in a repository with the server of compilation and ensures every single change in the application is being validated in the recopilation of the questions and the unit tests. 
The main objectives of continuous integration are: find and correct errors faster and optimize software quality.In addition, it also reduces the time it takes to validate and release new versions of an application.


-Continuous delivery:Step that is made after continuous integration. It is about having the necessary elements of the application for its distribution.


-Continuous deployment:Very similar to continuous delivery. However, in this mode, after the build server performs the validation of the build and code, the package is also prepared. However, the distribution / deployment is done automatically in the desired environment.
